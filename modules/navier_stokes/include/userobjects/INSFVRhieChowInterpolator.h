 * performs an interpolation (first overbar operation) and reconstruction (second overbar operation)
 * of the 'B' data before applying it to the momentum residuals as suggested by Moukalled.
 * Additionally it performs one more interpolation on 'B' to the faces and includes the difference
 * of this third overbar operation and the first overbar operation in the computation of the
 * Rhie-Chow velocity, which this object computes and provides to momentum advection kernels. This
 * class also supports computation of an average face velocity although this is generally not
 * encouraged as it will lead to a checkerboard in the pressure field
